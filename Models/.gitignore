# Ignore common ML model artifacts and large binary files
# Place this file in the Models/ directory to avoid committing model files.

# Keras / TensorFlow model files
*.h5
*.hdf5
*.keras
# PyTorch
*.pt
*.pth

# Checkpoints
*.ckpt
*.ckpt.index

# TensorFlow protobufs / frozen graphs
*.pb

# ONNX / TFLite
*.onnx
*.tflite

# Scikit-learn / joblib / pickle
*.joblib
*.pkl
*.sav

# NumPy arrays
*.npy
*.npz

# Other binaries
*.bin
*.weights

# Keep the .gitignore itself
!.gitignore

# Note: If model files are already tracked by git, add and run in repo root:
#   git rm --cached Models/<model-file>
# then commit to stop tracking them. This file only prevents new files from being added.
